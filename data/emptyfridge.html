			We created a prototype of a service that can be an extension to a recipe-ingredient conversion service available on online grocery stores such as kolonial.no. Using available data of recipe, ingredient amout and packaging portion, potential waste is calculated from the set of selected menus. We then compute waste score which takes into account waste amount, days till expiration, and waste value which would reflect amount of resources used to product the ingredient. The service also suggests a list of substitutes that would reduce the score.

			Household accounts for up to 33% of food waste. To alleviate the problem, we looked at a possiblity that comes with an emerging trend of online grocery stores. Some of the platform, such as kolonial.no, offers a recipe service where users can choose the menu, and the ingredients will be put into cart, using data about recipe and packaging portion. We see that this service can be extended further by using the same information to predict potential waste from a selected set of menus.

	Household accounts for up to 33% of food waste. To alleviate the problem, we looked at a possiblity that comes with an emerging trend of online grocery stores. Some of the platform, such as ___, offers a recipe service where users can choose the menu, and the ingredients will be put into cart, using data about recipe and packaging portion. We see that this service can be extended further by using the same information to predict potential waste from a selected set of menus.

	We compute waste amount of each ingredient from the recipe and packaging portion. Waste score takes into account waste amount, days till expiration, and waste value which reflects amount of resources used to product the ingredient.

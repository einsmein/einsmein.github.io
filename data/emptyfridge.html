			Household accounts for up to 33% of food waste. We created a prototype of a service that can be an extension to a recipe-ingredient conversion service available on online grocery stores such as kolonial.no. Using available data of recipe, ingredient amout and packaging portion, potential waste is calculated from the set of selected menus. We then compute waste score which takes into account waste amount, days till expiration, and waste value which would reflect amount of resources used to product the ingredient. The service also suggests a list of substitutes that would reduce the score.

			<p>Prevalence of neural network application calls for faster and more energy efficient way to perform matrix multiplication. We simulated and analyzed performance of systolic array by measureing hardware utilization and the number of cycles used in simple neural network operations: feed forward and backpropogation. We also imposed realistic condition which is fixed array size and limited memory bandwidth. As assumed, we found that the utilization is better in fixed size implementation although it takes more cycles. Memory bandwidth is a biggest hindrance of systolic array, thus qualifies its potential to scales.

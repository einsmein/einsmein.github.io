				Distributed controller and load balancer are proposed to maximize SDN (Software Defined Network) performance. In this project, we investigated a load balancer of SDN controller proposed by Jinke Yu et al. The paper used load informing strategy for communication among controllers. We suspected that in an unfortunate scenario where load continuously wavers, there could be large amount of unnecessary traffic. To verify whether this fluctuation happens in the real scenario, we implemented the proposed mechanism and simulated the communication among controllers with real traffic. It was found that it does happen, but so rarely that it should not affect network performance.

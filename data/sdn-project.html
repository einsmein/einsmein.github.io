	Shifting towards programmable network, SDN controller is proposed to be an interface between control plane and data plane. To achieve scalability and reliability, it is necessary to use distributed controllers, equipped with communication mechanism for effective load balancing. In this project, we studied research papers that suggested algorithm for that. We inspected a problem that might occur in one of the algorithm and evaluate it against real traffic data.

			Anchor damage is one of the main human causes of coral reef degradation in the south of Thailand. This is due to an increase in snorkeling tour boat as the number of tourists climbs up. Currently a large concrete block is used as a moor, but due to the size, its installation in the coral reef is rather restricted. To accommodate many more boats, we designed a mooring buoy, aiming to minimize footprint on the ocean floor. We also looked at the potential to add sensors to obtain relevant data which would provide additional value to the product.
			This project is still under development.
